# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 daily problems, written in C. Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers sharpen their skills through a series of programming puzzles of varying difficulty.

## Usage

A makefile is provided to compile and run the solutions. The makefile assumes that the [GNU C Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is installed.

### Commands (replace `x` with the desired day, e.g., `day=5`)

- Run `make test day=x` to test the solution with the test(s) from the puzzle description.
- Run `make input day=x` to test the solution with the puzzle input.
- Run `make anscheck day=x` to check that the output is correct.
- Run `make memcheck day=x` to check for memory leaks/errors.
- Run `make clean` to remove all compiled files.
