# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 daily problems, written in `C`. Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers sharpen their skills through a series of programming puzzles of varying difficulty.

## Usage

### Tests

In order to test a solution with the sample input from the problem statement, run (replace `x` with the day, e.g. `day=5`):

```bash
make test day=x
```

### Inputs

In order to test a solution with the puzzle input, run (replace `x` with the day, e.g. `day=5`):

```bash
make input day=x
```

If you wish to run on your personal puzzle input, replace `inputs/day_x.in`, where `x` is the day (e.g. `inputs/day_5.in`).
